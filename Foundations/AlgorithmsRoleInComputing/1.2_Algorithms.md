## Exercises

### 1.2-1 Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.


### 1.2-2 Suppose that for inputs of size _n_ on a particular computer, insertion sort runs in _8 * n * n_ steps and merge sort runs in _64 * n * lg n_ steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

### 1.2-3 What is the smallest value of _n_ such that an algorithm whose running time is 100 * _n * n_ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is _2^n_ on the same machine?

## Problems

### 1-1 Comparison of running times

For each function _f(n)_ and time in the following table, determine the largest size _n_ of a problem that can be solved in time _t_, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes microseconds _f(n)_ seconds.
